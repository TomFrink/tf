          My name is Tom Frink.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy helping people. I've made a career out of helping people.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to understand what people need to serve them best. You
          might say, you need to know what they need better than they do.
        </p>

        <p>
          I find the best method of understanding what people need is to use
          empathy. To say to yourself, if I were { this person }, how would I
          want to { solve this problem }? And expand on it from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's have some fun!
